            What up, I'm Maura, I'm 24 and I never fucking learned how to code. If you couldn't tell by the first sentence,
            yes, I do still quote Vines all the time and if you have no idea what I'm talking about click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqCCBohjaqA" target="_blank">here.</a>
            
            I was born in Philadelphia and grew up playing soccer starting from the age of four
            and played all through out college at Capital Univeristy in Columbus, OH. I studied Communications with an 
            emphasis in Public Relations and soon after graduating in 2016 learned that this was not the career for me. I wish I would have figured that out in college.
        </p>
        <p>
            After moving home from Columbus, I started self teaching myself how to code while looking for a job as a way to gain some more skills
            and then realized that I liked it enough to possibly make a career out of it. Currently,I work in fundraising at a 
            local university, but am looking to make a career change into the tech field.  Outside of coding, my hobbies include:
                <ul>
                    <li>reading - last year I read 52 books in 52 weeks</li>
                    <li>learning new languages - I am almost fluent in Spanish and I'm learning Italian</li>
                    <li>travelling - I want to travel to all 50 states before I turn 50</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            If anyone has any book recommendations, please send them my way - or if you're in need of some, let me know
            I love sharing my favorite reads with people. I also just got back into playing Pok&#233;monGo so if anyone wants to be friends
            on that - dm me on slack!
