                What up, I'm Maura, I'm 24 and I never fucking learned how to code. If you couldn't tell by the first sentence,
                yes, I do still quote Vines all the time and if you have no idea what I'm talking about click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqCCBohjaqA" target="_blank">here.</a>
                
                I was born in Philadelphia and grew up playing soccer starting from the age of four
                and played all through out college at Capital Univeristy in Columbus, OH. I studied Communications with an 
                emphasis in Public Relations and soon learned that this was not the career for me. I wish I would have figured that out in college.

                Currently, I work in fundraising at a local university, but am looking to make a career change into the tech field. Outside of coding,
                my hobbies include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>reading - last year I read 52 books in 52 weeks</li>
                        <li>learning new languages - I am almost fluent in Spanish and I'm learning Italian</li>
                        <li>travelling - I want to travel to all 50 states before I turn 50</li>
                    </ul>
